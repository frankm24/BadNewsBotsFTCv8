Written by Frank Murphy, 6/13/2022

The purpose of this WRAPPER class is to expand the functionality of the robotcore Gamepad class to automatically
handle button press and release detection rather than only detecting if a button is down. This works by storing the
values of each controller button from the previous frame, rather than using a debounce timer, which we used previously.
This class is designed to run synchronously with the main loop of an OpMode. Additional functionality will be added
as needed.

NOTE: ALL OF THESE VARIABLES ARE READ ONLY FROM OUTSIDE GAMEPADEX
NOTE 2: Not currently implementing the PS4-only values, such as touchpad because we do not use PS4 controllers.
